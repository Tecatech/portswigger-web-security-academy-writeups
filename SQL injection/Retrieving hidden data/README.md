# Retrieving hidden data

## SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out an SQL query like the following:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```

To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection attack that causes the application to display details of all products in any category, both released and unreleased.
